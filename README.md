# Build-time-microfrontend-integration setup

This project demonstrates a build-time microfrontend integration approach using React. It consists of two separate React applications:

1. app-shell: The main container application that injects the microfrontend at build time.

2. microfrontend-header: A microfrontend providing a header component.

**Project Structure**

build-time-microfrontend-integration/
|-- app-shell/
|-- microfrontend-header/


## How It Works

* app-shell serves as the host and runs on port 3000.
* 
* microfrontend-header provides a React-based header component and runs on port 3001.
* 
* During the build process, app-shell pulls in microfrontend-header and integrates it.
